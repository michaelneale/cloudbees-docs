GrandCentral (https://www.grandcentral.com/) is the primary dashboard for
managing your CloudBees account.  The GrandCentral dashboard provides you with
an overview of your CloudBees resources. The Account settings pages (available
from the gear icon in the toolbar) let you perform tasks like managing users,
subscriptions and billing.  The settings pages also provide tools for managing
your User settings like your email, password and API keys.
